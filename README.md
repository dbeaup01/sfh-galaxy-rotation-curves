# sfh-galaxy-rotation-curves
Reproducible analysis of disk galaxy rotation curves in the Spacetime Flow Hypothesis (SFH), using observed baryonic mass distributions only. The framework reproduces inner rises, flat outer profiles, and dense-core suppression across a 20-galaxy benchmark sample without invoking dark matter halos or modified force laws.
