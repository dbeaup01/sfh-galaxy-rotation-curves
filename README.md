# sfh-galaxy-rotation-curves
Reproducible analysis of disk galaxy rotation curves in the Spacetime Flow Hypothesis (SFH), using observed baryonic mass distributions only. The framework reproduces inner rises, flat outer profiles, and dense-core suppression across a 20-galaxy benchmark sample without invoking dark matter halos or modified force laws.

# SPARC Baryonic Rotation-Curve Decomposition Data

This directory contains baryonic rotation-curve decomposition files used in the
analysis presented in:

> Beaupré, D. (2026),  
> *Galaxy Rotation Curves Without Dark Matter Halos: A First-Principles Causal Framework*.

The archive `Rotmod_LTG.zip` contains rotation-model (rotmod) files derived from
the **SPARC (Spitzer Photometry & Accurate Rotation Curves)** database.

## Original Data Source

The SPARC database was compiled and released by:

- Lelli, F., McGaugh, S. S., & Schombert, J. M. (2016),  
  *SPARC: Mass Models for 175 Disk Galaxies with Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves*,  
  **The Astronomical Journal**, 152, 157

The original data remain the intellectual property of the SPARC collaboration
and are publicly available for scientific use.

## Redistribution and Use

The files provided here are redistributed **unchanged** and **without modification**
for the sole purpose of ensuring **computational reproducibility** of the results
reported in the above publication.

No claim of ownership over the original SPARC data is made.

Users of these data **must cite the original SPARC reference** listed above in any
derivative work or analysis.

## Notes

- These files are used exclusively to compute baryonic contributions to galaxy
  rotation curves.
- No dark-matter halo models or empirical fitting functions are included.
